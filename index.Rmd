## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to The Relationship between democracy and the economic outcomes. I am thinking of using the scale of democracy using Freedom House that is easily accessible in the Internet. Other than that, the economic outcomes can be measured using the innate GDP data in the R Studio, and around the internet.
